Warmup: Big O
Answer the following Big O notation questions, and store the answers in your README.md for this assignment.

Think carefully about what tasks the JavaScript compiler actually has to run through to make them happen (or in other words, what code you'd have to write yourself to do them if the method didn't exist).

Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

Accessing an item by index in an array
O(1) because array is an object. Time is independent of its size

Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
O(n) because we have to shift all the elements of the array by one index

Pushing an item onto the end of an array
O(1) because we need to access the length property of an array

Upcasing a String
O(n) because we have to loop

Reversing a String

Finding the max of an array

splitting a String

Inserting a value to an Object

Retrieving the keys of an Object ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
